## Project Title
Breakdown of High vs. Low grossing Disney Movies

## Team Members
*Matt Weiper
*Hema Vyas

## Project Description/Outline
What factors high-grossing Disney movies have that low-grossing Disney movies do not. Our goal is to find out what the common theme is between the high-grossing movies and how they differ from the low-grossing.

## Research Questions to Answer
*Is genre a factor into low vs. high?
*Is rating a factor into low vs. high?
*Is director a factor into low vs. high?
*Is release date a factor into low vs. high?

These are determinants we want to dive into and see if there is any common trend amongst the highest grossing Disney movies and the lowest grossing Disney movies
## Datasets to Be Used

*We will need to find the directors of films and merge them to this dataframe (also can manually put them in a column)

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
First, we will need to collect the datasets needed to answer above questions. Then we will interpret and clean data, leaving only information we are needing for study. Next, we will merge datasets and create plots to show specific answers to questions (e.g. top 5 movies genres vs. lower 5, etc.). Lastly, we will write a summary with our findings.
